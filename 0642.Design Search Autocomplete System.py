642.Design Search Autocomplete System
Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. Here are the specific rules:
1.	The hot degree for a sentence is defined as the number of times a user typed the exactly same sentence before.
2.	The returned top 3 hot sentences should be sorted by hot degree (The first is the hottest one). If several sentences have the same degree of hot, you need to use ASCII-code order (smaller one appears first).
3.	If less than 3 hot sentences exist, then just return as many as you can.
4.	When the input is a special character, it means the sentence ends, and in this case, you need to return an empty list.
Your job is to implement the following functions:
The constructor function:
AutocompleteSystem(String[] sentences, int[] times): This is the constructor. The input is historical data. Sentences is a string array consists of previously typed sentences. Times is the corresponding times a sentence has been typed. Your system should record these historical data.
Now, the user wants to input a new sentence. The following function will provide the next character the user types:
List<String> input(char c): The input c is the next character typed by the user. The character will only be lower-case letters ('a' to 'z'), blank space (' ') or a special character ('#'). Also, the previously typed sentence should be recorded in your system. The output will be the top 3 historical hot sentences that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed.
